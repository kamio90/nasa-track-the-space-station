# ISS LOOKOUT

## Project
Project was developed on hackaton "NASA Space Apps Challenge 2022". For this reason it is better not to look at the commit history, because programming 48h without sleep is hard in the code, but calmly as it says "I will refactor it later".
## HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY
We have prepared a web application to track the location of the ISS. In addition, we have equipped our site with a simulation of the entire solar system with the possibility of recreating the position of all celestial bodies with the space station at a given moment. The ISS model is changing in line with its real historical development. We can inspect each part of the space station with a brief description, and we can check what astronauts were in orbit at a given time. Additionally, we can observe the position of the ISS in relation to the globe live.
## DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Our application allows you to recreate the historical position of the celestial bodies and ISS stations. The station model and its components are changing in line with its historical development. The page shows a simulation of our solar system. We can inspect each segment of ISS with its brief description. We provide information about the current ISS crew and the livestreams or movies they host on the web.

All these facilities allow you to get to know the structure, purpose, mode of operation and appearance of the international space station in a very pleasant and accessible way. This is a huge source of knowledge for people looking for information on this topic. We hope that our application will encourage young people to engage in engineering topics and deepen their knowledge of one of the most important steps in space exploration. Distinguishing ourselves from similar applications, we focus on easy access to large amounts of data, both historical and present (live). Refined graphics and intuitive controls are our main priority.

The project was based on a graphics engine based on the Three.js framework, using Api to track real ISS parameters. During development, we used Webpack with a local python server, using languages ​​such as python, java script and html5. We used the git version control system. Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. The source code is hosted in a repository on GitHub.
## HACKATHON JOURNEY
We chose this topic because it seemed the most interesting and the least obvious. The simplicity of the command forced us to go beyond the thinking pattern and find an unusual approach to the subject. Our team had a great time overcoming many encountered problems, which we managed to solve again and again thanks to brainstorming and unusual ideas from equal IT fields. We learned to work in a completely new environment, we also learned an exorbitant amount of knowledge about the ISS and its history. Not to mention the solar system itself, but also the forces that govern it. We tried to create something unique, accessible to a younger audience, simple and at the same time having unlimited potential for future development.
