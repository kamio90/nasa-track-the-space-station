Big time enevs on ISS:
    -Reagan directs NASA to build the ISS
1984 Jan. 25
    -Space Shuttle Challenger breaks apart 73 sec. after liftoff on STS-51L, the program’s 25th mission, claiming the lives of seven astronauts. The fleet is grounded for 2.5 years, delaying Reagan’s goal of completing the station by 1994.
1986 Jan. 28
    -On the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, President George H.W. Bush unveils the Space Exploration Initiative, calling on the U.S. to return to the Moon and eventually send explorers to Mars. The plan extends support for Space Station Freedom, but debate continues over its design, mission and cost.
1989 July 20
    -The Soviet Union collapses. Russia inherits the Soviet space program and seeks civil space partners for its programs, including the Mir space station, whose nine-year assembly began in early 1986. The U.S. and Russia kick off a new alliance with a series of astronaut-cosmonaut exchanges. First step: Figure out how to dock a space shuttle at Mir.
1991 Dec 25
    -An effort in the U.S. House of Representatives to terminate Space Station Freedom fails, 216-215; the late Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) casts the deciding vote. Despite NASA’s recovery from the Challenger tragedy and opportunities to cooperate with Russia and other nations in the aftermath of the Cold War, congressional support for the increasingly costly project is marginal during Bill Clinton’s presidency.
1993 June 23
    -Russia and NASA merge space station development efforts, leading to the first shuttle mission to rendezvous with Mir, in February 1994. Pictured aboard Mir is cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov.
1993 October
    -NASA launches physician Norman Thagard with two cosmonauts on the Soyuz TM-21 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. He is the first of seven NASA astronauts who serve on Mir from March 1995 to June 1998, a difficult period of ISS design and development.
1995 March 14
    -The U.S. shuttle Atlantis, commanded by Robert “Hoot” Gibson, docks at Mir for the first time.
1995 June 19
    -Mir is struck by an unmanned, automated Progress cargo-vessel docking rehearsal, damaging a solar array and causing a dangerous depressurization, a reminder of the hazards of spaceflight. NASA astronaut Michael Foale joins cosmonauts for spacewalk repairs during his 145-day stay at the station. Mir is deorbited in March 2001.
1997 June 26
    -NASA gathers high-ranking officials from 15 nations in Washington to sign agreements for the design, development, operation and utilization of the ISS.

    -NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko return to Earth from the ISS aboard the Soyuz TMA-18M capsule in remote Kazakhstan, concluding a 340-day mission, the longest ever for a U.S. astronaut. Dozens of science investigations involving Kelly and his Earth-based twin brother, Mark Kelly, also a NASA astronaut, study changes that the human body undergoes down to the genetic level in the absence of gravity.
2016 March 1
    -NASA astronauts Jeffrey Williams and Kathleen Rubins conduct a spacewalk that equips the ISS with its first International Docking Adapter (IDA) at the forward end of the Harmony module, previously the primary docking port for space shuttles. The IDA was developed to accommodate future Boeing CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX Crew Dragon capsules transporting astronauts and cosmonauts to the ISS. The IDA design is available for use on multinational spacecraft to encourage future joint operations. A second IDA is installed atop Harmony during a spacewalk by NASA astronauts Nick Hague and Andrew Morgan on Aug. 21, 2019.
2016 Aug. 19
    -NASA astronaut Kathleen Rubins, a microbiologist, becomes the first person to sequence DNA from space as part of the Biomolecule Sequencer experiment, using mouse, virus and bacteria samples. This enables an ability to better diagnose human health issues from space and to identify the source of spacecraft contamination as well as DNA-based life forms found beyond Earth.
2016 Aug. 27-28
    -NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson sets a U.S. career record of 665 days in space as she concludes a 289-day mission to the ISS with a landing in Kazakhstan aboard Russia's Soyuz MS-04 with fellow U.S. astronaut Jack Fischer and cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin. It is Whitson’s third trip to the station. She participates in 10 spacewalks during her time on the ISS.
2017 Sept. 2
    -Vice President Mike Pence, chair of the White House National Space Council, directs NASA to return to the surface of the Moon with astronauts in 2024, four years sooner than previously planned. The strategy calls on NASA to transition oversight of low-Earth-orbit activities such as those on the ISS to the commercial sector.
2019 March 26
    -NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Christina Koch conduct the first all-female spacewalk, the 221st outing devoted to the assembly and maintenance of the ISS.
